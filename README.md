# About
Prim's Algorithm creates a minimum spanning tree (MST) from a weighted graph.

This implementation creates a bare-bones weighted graph structure and non-binary tree structure
to showcase how this algorithm works. 
A provided jupyter notebook goes further indepth on how the algorithm works and demonstrates it's process.
